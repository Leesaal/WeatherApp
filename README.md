# WeatherApp


## Description

This project was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript and uses APIs to showcase the weather for the current day as well as the future 5 day weather forecast.  

This project saves the searched cities so the user can see what cities they have searched in the past as well as clear the local storage search history.  Searching creates buttons to click underneath the search bar to click and return to a previous search.

Two API's were used to showcase fetching from multiple APIs in one webpage.

PLEASE NOTE:  The app appears without the "undefined" button when loading through safari and from a local folder but Chrome is showing a button on load only on the github pages site.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This code can be used to show the current and 5 day future forecast for a searched city.  As well as store previous searches and access them later.

## Credits

APIs from OpenWeatherMap.

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

## Features

This code features:
1. Save searched cities into local storage
2. Use of APIs to gather weather data from OpenWeatherMap
3. Display weather data based on input city
4. Search by clicking on previous searches

## Tests

There are no tests currently.

## Limitations

Currently I have used a work around in order to clear all data from the page by pushing for the page to reload and automatically delete the data.  This would need to be fixed in a future development.

## Future improvements

1. Remove li elements rather than reloading page to remove added search history items
2. Use one API to make more efficient coding
3. Change the CSS styling depending on screensize
4. Limit the local storage to 5 items
5. Understand why chrome is showing an undefined button and fic
